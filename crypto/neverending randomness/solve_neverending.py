# Build linear map for one MT step on a single bit position across the 624-word state.
# We won’t rederive the twist; instead we leverage the *observed outputs* relation:
# the untempered output sequence is a linear function of the internal state over GF(2).
#
# Practical approach:
# We do not assemble A (19968x19968). Instead, we recover *consecutive* untempered outputs
# by solving a stride-k (k=72) linear recurrence directly on untempered outputs:
# For MT19937, untempered outputs y_i satisfy a 624th order linear recurrence over GF(2).
# => y_{i+N} = sum_j c_j * y_{i+j}, with fixed coefficients c_j.
# Those coefficients can be *learned* once by probing the generator from any seed.
#
# Plan:
#  1) From a dummy MT instance, generate 2*N untempered words Y[0..2N-1].
#  2) Solve for coefficients C[0..N-1] that satisfy Y[i+N] = sum_j C[j]*Y[i+j] (bitwise, over GF(2)).
#  3) Now, your leaked untempered stream L is every k-th output, but still satisfies
#     a linear recurrence of order N as well (with different coefficients D). We can *learn D*
#     the same way: take any MT, subsample every k-th, fit recurrence.
#  4) With enough leaked points (you have 3*#samples), reconstruct **N consecutive decimated outputs**
#     using Berlekamp–Massey over GF(2) on each bit lane, then *interleave* to recover N consecutive
#     *actual* outputs via LFSR extension. Finally, run the standard "clone from 624 consecutive outputs".
#
# This keeps code short and robust.
