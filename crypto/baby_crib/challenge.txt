Ah dang it. I forgot the key to a really important piece of information. Thankfully I have something else encoded with the same key and a friend who is really good at crypto stuff told me I can use it to get back the thing I really care about. I don't know what encryption is used but he said not to worry, I can figure it out with some carefully crafted inputs.He said even a baby fresh out of the crib could do this, but I have no idea how.
