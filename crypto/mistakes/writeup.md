# Crypto CTF Challenge: "mistake" - Write-up

## üìã Challenge Overview

**Challenge Name:** mistake  
**Category:** Cryptography  
**Server:** `nc ctf.ac.upt.ro 9541`  
**Description:** "We all make mistakes. It's important to learn from them."

This challenge involves a cryptographic scheme based on **Learning With Errors (LWE)** that contains a critical design flaw, allowing us to recover the hidden message without knowing the secret key.

## üìÅ Getting Challenge Files

To obtain the challenge data, connect to the server:

```bash
nc ctf.ac.upt.ro 9541 > mistake.txt
```

This will download a JSON file containing:

- Matrix **A** of dimensions `m √ó n`
- Vector **b** of size `m`
- Metadata including various parameters:
  - `q = 3329` (modulus)
  - `n = 128` (secret dimension)
  - `m = 808` (number of samples)
  - `L = 552` (message length in bits)

---

## üîç Initial Analysis

### Understanding LWE

Learning With Errors (LWE) is a cryptographic problem where each sample follows the equation:

```
b_i ‚â° ‚ü®a_i, s‚ü© + e_i + m_i ¬∑ (q/4) (mod q)
```

Where:

- `a_i` is a row vector from matrix A
- `s` is the secret vector (unknown)
- `e_i` is a small error term
- `m_i` is the message bit (0 or 1)
- The term `q/4` is added when the message bit is 1

### Key Observations After Data Examination

1. **Unusually Small Coefficients in Matrix A**

   - Matrix entries are constrained to `{0,1,2,3,4,5,3324,3325,3326,3327,3328}`
   - When reduced modulo q=3329, these represent the range `[-5, 5]`
   - This is extremely small for a secure LWE implementation

2. **Binary Clustering Pattern in Vector b**

   - Values in `b` cluster around two distinct levels:
     - Near `0` (representing message bit 0)
     - Near `q/4 ‚âà 832.25` (representing message bit 1)
   - Clear separation between the two clusters
   - No values appear near `q/2` or `3q/4`

3. **Minimal Noise Impact**
   - The combined effect of `‚ü®a_i, s‚ü© + e_i` is very small
   - Much smaller than the separation distance `q/4`
   - This allows direct bit classification without knowing the secret!

## üéØ The Critical Vulnerability

The "mistake" in this LWE implementation is a **parameter selection flaw**:

- **Insufficient masking**: The noise and secret contribution is so small compared to the message encoding offset (`q/4`) that we can directly classify each `b_i` value
- **Direct bit recovery**: We can determine each message bit by simply checking whether `b_i` is closer to 0 or `q/4`
- **Bypassed security**: This completely circumvents the hardness of the LWE problem

### Mathematical Insight

For secure LWE, the term `‚ü®a_i, s‚ü© + e_i` should be large enough to mask the message encoding. Here:

- `‚ü®a_i, s‚ü©` is bounded by `|s| * 5` (very small)
- `e_i` is also small
- Combined effect << `q/4` = 832.25

This creates **trivial distinguishability** between message bits.

## üîß Solution Strategy

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Data Extraction**

   - Parse the JSON structure from `mistake.txt`
   - Extract vector `b` and metadata parameters

2. **Bit Classification Algorithm**

   - For each `b_i`, calculate cyclic distances to 0 and `q/4`
   - Choose the nearest target as the decoded bit
   - Handle modular arithmetic wraparound correctly

3. **Message Reconstruction**

   - Extract the first `L = 552` bits from the classification
   - Pack bits into bytes using little-endian bit ordering
   - Decode the resulting bytes as UTF-8 text

4. **Flag Extraction**
   - The decoded text should contain the CTF flag
