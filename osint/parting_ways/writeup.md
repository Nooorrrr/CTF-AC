OSINT CTF Writeup ‚Äî Parting Ways ChallThe riddle text provides several important hints:

- "ancient kingdom of the Teutons" ‚Üí refers to Germany
- "fortress with 71 noble houses" ‚Üí Kelheim is known for its historical fortress
- "two brothers parting ways, dividing into three branches" ‚Üí This points to the rivers Danube and Altm√ºhl, which meet near Kelheim, and the Danube's branching channels

This geographic description fits perfectly with Kelheim's location.

## Step 5: Flag ConstructionChallenge Overview

We were given the following riddle:

"In the ancient kingdom of the Teutons there was a fortress with 71 noble houses‚Ä¶ two brothers‚Ä¶ three branches form a bridge‚Ä¶ Where did the two brothers part ways?"

We also had two pictures:
- A scenic photo of a river bend with a small town
- A cropped version focused on the town

Flag format: CTF{town_name}

## Step 1: Image Analysis

The picture shows:
- A river making a bend
- A sandy beach-like area on the inside of the bend
- A small town with red-roof houses
- Photo is taken from a wooded hillside above the town

This appeared to be a European riverside town.

## Step 2: Reverse Image Search

To identify the location, I used Google Image Search:
- I cropped the picture to focus on the town and river bend, removing the trees
- This makes the search engine concentrate on the unique geography and houses, not just the forest

## Step 3: Search Results

The search results matched with photos of Kelheim, a town in Bavaria, Germany.

One result showed Ferienhaus Andadoana, Kelheim with the same river bend and town layout visible in the CTF image, confirming the location.

## Step 4: Connecting the Clues

The riddle text mentions:

"ancient kingdom of the Teutons" ‚Üí refers to Germany.

"fortress with 71 noble houses" ‚Üí Kelheim is known for its old fortress history.

"two brothers parting ways, dividing into three branches" ‚Üí This points to the rivers Danube and Altm√ºhl, which meet near Kelheim, and the Danube‚Äôs branching channels.

This fits perfectly with the geography of Kelheim.
