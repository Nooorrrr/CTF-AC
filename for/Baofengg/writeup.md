## Solution : 
Ive maneged to clean and enhance the audio with the use of https://podcast.adobe.com/en/enhance and then I extracted the speech with the use of this website : https://www.speech-to-text.cloud/ and got this:    
```
[00:00:00]
Secure, secure, secure. This is Yankee Oscar 2 Tango Sierra Sierra. My keycage is Kilo November 15 Kilo Sierra.
[00:00:08]
Secure, secure, secure. This is Yankee Oscar 2 Tango Sierra Sierra.
```
I reconized with the help of : https://www.worldometers.info/languages/nato-phonetic-alphabet/ that those words where phonetic alphabets and that the callsign was ```YO2TSS``` as for the city I googled ```KN15KS``` and found out that it refers to ```Hunedoara``` , making the flag :     
```ctf{YO2TSS,Hunedoara}```
